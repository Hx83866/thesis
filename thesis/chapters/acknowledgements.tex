Furthermore, I would like to thank Professor Schroeder, who kindly agreed to support me as the co-examiner of my thesis.

I would also like to thank my daily supervisors Seran and Marco, who accompanied and heavily supported me throughout the whole writing process of my thesis.
I could always rely on their masterly guidance through all the obstacles I have encountered.

A sincere thank you is dedicated to Katja and Philip for their diligent proofreading and valuable feedback.

Last but no least, I would like thank my parents for their unconditional love and support during my whole life.
I would have never been able to succeed through my academic journey without their help.
